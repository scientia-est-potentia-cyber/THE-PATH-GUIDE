	<div class="page-header"><h3>Intro</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<h1 style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<strong>Welcome to my compendium, my name is Kevin and i go by the name Scientia online. I will guide you on your path to become a hacker, from my point of view.</strong></h1>
<h2 style="margin-left: 80px;">
	&nbsp;</h2>
<h2 style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<strong>A bit about me:</strong></h2>
<p style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<strong>My name is Kevin. I go by Scientia online, and I have been in love whit computers since I was twelve. I love animals, drawing, and nature, But I would rather be at my computer at home, developing and learning, which I am most of the time. I belong in Randers now (I am originally from Horsens). I listen to highly diverse music and am always open to new suggestions! I hear almost everything or listen to a track before I reject it.</strong><br>
	&nbsp;</p>
</section>
<section id="hacker_types">
	<div class="page-header"><h3>Hacker Types</h3><hr class="notop"></div>
<p>
	There is a couple of different types, in my opinion.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<img alt="" src="assets/images/image_1.png"  ></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	1. White Hat Hackers</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	White hat hackers are types of hackers who&rsquo;re professionals with expertise in cybersecurity. They are authorized or certified to hack the systems. These White Hat Hackers work for governments or organizations by getting into the system. They hack the system from the loopholes in the cybersecurity of the organization. This hacking is done to test the level of cybersecurity in their organization. By doing so, they identify the weak points and fix them to avoid attacks from external sources. White hat hackers work as per the rules and regulations set by the government. White hat hackers are also known as ethical hackers.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Motives &amp; Aims:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The goals of these types of hackers are helping businesses and an appetite for detecting gaps in networks&rsquo; security. They aim to protect and assist companies in the ongoing battle against cyber threats. A White Hat hacker is any individual who will help protect the company from rising cybercrimes. They help enterprises create defenses, detect vulnerabilities, and solve them before other cybercriminals can find them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;2. Black Hat Hackers</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Black hat hackers are also knowledgeable computer experts but with the wrong intention. They attack other systems to get access to systems where they do not have authorized entry. On gaining entry, they might steal the data or destroy the system. The hacking practices used by these types of hackers depend on the individual&rsquo;s hacking capacity and knowledge. As the intentions of the hacker make the hacker a criminal. The malicious action intent of the individual cannot be gauged, either can the extent of the breach while hacking</p>
<p>
	.</p>
<p>
	Motives &amp; Aims:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	To hack into organizations&rsquo; networks and steal bank data, funds, or sensitive information. Normally, they use the stolen resources to profit themselves, sell them on the black market, or harass their target company.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	3. Gray Hat Hackers</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The intention behind the hacking is considered while categorizing the hacker. The Gray hat hacker falls in between the black hat hackers and white hat hackers. They are not certified hackers. These types of hackers work with either good or bad intentions. The hacking might be for their gain. The intention behind hacking decides the type of hacker. If the intention is for personal gain, then the hacker is considered to be a gray hat hacker.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Motives &amp; Aims:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The difference is, they don&rsquo;t want to rob people nor want to help people in particular. Rather, they enjoy experimenting with systems to find loopholes, crack defenses, and generally find a fun hacking experience.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	4. Script Kiddies</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	It is a known fact that half knowledge is always dangerous. The Script Kiddies are amateurs types of hackers in the field of hacking. They try to hack the system with scripts from other fellow hackers. They try to hack the systems, networks, or websites. The intention behind the hacking is just to get attention from their peers. Script Kiddies are juveniles who do not have complete knowledge of the hacking process.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Motives &amp; Aims:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	One standard Kiddie Script attack is a DoS (Denial of Service) or DDoS attack (Distributed Denial of Service). This simply means that an IP address is flooded with too much excessive traffic that it collapses. Consider several Black Friday shopping websites, for instance. It creates confusion and prevents someone else uses the service.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	5. Green Hat Hackers</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Green hat hackers are types of hackers who&rsquo;re learning the ropes of hacking. They are slightly different from the Script Kiddies due to their intention. The intent is to strive and learn to become full-fledged hackers. They are looking for opportunities to learn from experienced hackers.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	6. Blue Hat Hackers</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Blue Hat Hackers are types of hackers who&rsquo;re similar to Script Kiddies. The intent to learn is missing. They use hacking as a weapon to gain popularity among their fellow beings. They use hacking to settle scores with their adversaries. Blue Hat Hackers are dangerous due to the intent behind the hacking rather than their knowledge.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	7. Red Hat Hackers</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Red Hat Hackers are synonymous with Eagle-Eyed Hackers. They are the types of hackers who&rsquo;re similar to white hackers. The red hat hackers intend to stop the attack of black hat hackers. The difference between red hat hackers and white hat hackers is that the process of hacking through intention remains the same. Red hat hackers are quite ruthless while dealing with black hat hackers or counteracting with malware. The red hat hackers continue to attack and may end up having to replace the entire system set up.</p>
<div>
	Above are seven types of hackers broadly referred to in the cybersecurity world.&nbsp;</div>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<div>
	The three types of hackers listed below work in different capacities.</div>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	State/Nation Sponsored Hackers</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Government appoints hackers to gain information about other countries. These types of hackers are known as State/Nation sponsored hackers. They use their knowledge to gain confidential information from other countries to be well prepared for any upcoming danger to their country. The sensitive information aids to be on top of every situation but also to avoid upcoming danger. They report only to their governments.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Hacktivist</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	These types of hackers intend to hack government websites. They pose themselves as activists, so known as a hacktivist. Hacktivist can be an individual or a bunch of nameless hackers whose intent is to gain access to government websites and networks. The data gained from government files accessed are used for personal political, or social gain.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Malicious insider or Whistleblower</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	These types of hackers include individuals working in an organization who can expose confidential information. The intent behind the exposure might be a personal grudge with the organization, or the individual might have come across illegal activities within the organization. The reason for expose defines the intent behind the exposure. These individuals are known as whistleblowers.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>
	&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>
	Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	Information is widely available over the internet. Keen individuals can learn and adapt to them immediately. The intent behind hacking is what sets the hackers apart. The knowledge is used for harming individuals or governments or for personal gain, which makes hackers dangerous. The types of hacker attacks vary from organization to organization. The intensity and type of attack are dependent on the hackers&rsquo; ability to find the loophole and penetrate the security system. This has put up a huge challenge to organizations and governments to be updated with&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	their cybersecurity at all times.<br>

	Additional programming languages for Hacking</p>
<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">
		<h3>
			Ruby:</h3>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Several hackers have used Ruby to exploit corporate systems. Ruby is often used to write either small or large scripts and is used interchangeably with Bash scripting.</p>
<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">
		<h3>
			Perl:</h3>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Perl still holds value in the hacker community for exploit writing. It is a great language that can help you manipulate Linux text files and create tools and exploits.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">
		<h3>
			HTML:</h3>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The HyperText Markup Language - <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/html-tutorial/what-is-html" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="HTML">HTML</a> is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML also finds its use in developing hybrid mobile and desktop apps. HTML is considered an easy language to learn. Hence, it is advised to master HTML if you want to compromise web apps.</p>
<ul>
	<li aria-level="1">
		<h3>
			Assembly:</h3>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	It is a complicated low-level programming language that is used for hacking primitive systems. Assembly language helps a hacker manipulate systems straight up at the architectural level. It is also the most appropriate coding language to build malware like viruses and trojans. Assembly is also the go-to choice if you want to reverse engineer a piece of software that has already been compiled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	That sums up the list of the additional best programming languages for hacking.</p>
